            <p>
                Well hello there! My name is Alin. I'm a <span id="age"></span> years old, Romanian, 7th semester ICT Engineering
                student currently living in Denmark. I moved here back in August 2014 when I started studying at VIA University
                College, Campus Horsens. During college I had courses such as Software Development with Java, .NET Development,
                Mobile Applications, Serious Games Development, Mixed Reality Applications, Responsive Web Design, Relational
                Databases, Programming Concepts and Languages, Applied Linear Algebra, Lego Robot Lab.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page has been built simply as a "Business card". It originally had zero text as most of the existing information could
                be already found on my Social Media and now it (hopefully) contains some kind of summary about myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The page itself is under continuous development. I'm planning to eventually animate it (as the original one was) with either
                CSS3 or via JavaScript and add multiple cover images (again, as the original one had).

                    <p>
                        During this period I worked on two primary tasks: A pocket companion dedicated to the people that had to install their EnergyConnectors
                        (Commissioning App) and redesigning their already existing interface (Energy Cloud).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both projects were web applications built under the .NET Framework (ASP.NET). As already mentioned The Commissioning App
                        represents a pocket companion, it is supposed to offer guides on how to install the EnergyConnectors
                        and test the connection with the freshly installed units with our servers, eventually help the person
                        troubleshoot in case something goes wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second task implies moving the old-static bootstrap-based interface to a widget based dynamic one, or a tile system as
                        we ended up calling it. The interface was built by using <a href="https://github.com/troolee/gridstack.js"
                            target="_blank">GridStack</a>, an OpenSource library that allows you to create drag-and-drop, multi-column
                        interfaces really easily.

            <h2>A self-building webpage</h2>
            <p>
                A totally not original idea. I would link the place where I've seen it but sadly I can't find it anymore. The entire idea
                behind this is having a "live coding" session where you see some CSS code in front of you and you see the
                entire page change right in front of your eyes! I have made two versions of this, first of them which is
                just so damn horrible as it was made while learning how to javascript, and the second one which was made
                around one year later, which is somewhat decent. I will be saving your sanity by only linking the most recent
                one.

                <li><a href="https://xshteff.github.io/Self-Building-Webpage-v2/" target="_blank">Demo</a></li>

            </ul>
            <h2>A JavaScript only Poker game!</h2>
            <p>
                Another project made while learning JavaScript. Sadly there's no re-master version of this one. You'll have to deal with
                one ridiculously long method that for some reason is recursive too, that decides whether or not you won or
                not. The entire game is made by using 0 images.

            </ul>
            <h2>TW Best Friends</h2>
            <p>
                TW stands for "The-West", which is the browser game mentioned in my experience section. This is an userscript, pretty much
                something that runs once the game loads and enhances your gaming experience. This script has been made with
                the help of Diggo11 who at the time was a Community Manager and a Game Developer for the game itself.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/xShteff/TW-Best-Friends" target="_blank">Repo</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The Magic Bundle</h2>
            <p>
                Again, an userscript for The-West. This one has two versions as well, in this case they are not separate. First of them has
                been made while learning how to work with JavaScript and the final version has been done a bit later. It
                contains a bunch of older projects merged into only one. It provides features such as improved notifications,
                a task killer, it auto-buys products for you, it adds a new Veteran Point counter (at the time there was
                no way of seeing them), and a fancy shmancy neon experience bar (which yes, is useless but cool).
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/xShteff/TWKappa" target="_blank">Repo</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>TW Kappa</h2>
            <p>
                Yet another userscript. This one integrates <a href="https://twitch.tv" target="_blank">twitch.tv's</a> emoticon
                list into The-West! ...and a few extra ones. That's it. Oh, the script uses an API hosted by <a href="http://twitchemotes.com"
                    target="_blank">twitchemotes.com</a>. I apparently have to mention that otherwise I'd be in trouble.
