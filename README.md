# Personal Webpage

Over the years, I always tried to maintain a "fancy" website that I would probably never use.
During 2018 I've went through several iterations and still was not happy with whatever results I got.
2019 will be a bit different, I will be focusing strictly on the process I'm going through in order to achieve something nice

## Dependencies

All dependencies are fetched via npm. If you want to download them just run `npm install`. After running that, you will have to use `gulpjs` in order to move
all the dependencies to their right place. Simply executing the `gulp` command will create copies of all the required files into the /dist/ folder.
