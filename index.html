            <p>
                Well hello there! My name is Alin. I'm a <span id="age"></span> years old, Computer Engineering graduate currently living in Denmark. I moved here back in August 2014 when I started studying at VIA University College,
                Campus Horsens. During college I had courses such as Software Development with Java, .NET Development, Mobile Applications (Android), Serious Games Development, Mixed Reality Applications, Responsive Web Design, Relational Databases, Programming
                Concepts and Languages, Applied Linear Algebra, Lego Robot Lab, Single WebPage Applications, Linear Algebra, Stochastic Modelling and Processing. As of January of 2018 I have graduated college and managed to do so without failing a single class.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm planning to keep this page as a "Business Card", where you can find <b>some</b> information about myself. If you wish to keep on stalking me feel free to make use of the social media links placed at the bottom of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any specific questions feel free to contact me via mail at <a href="mailto:alinstefanolaru@gmail.com">alinstefanolaru@gmail.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The page is under continuous development.

            <h2>JSLines</h2>
            <p>
                Attempting to make a puzzle-esque game I used to play as a child. The idea is simple: you play on a 9x9 grid and start with five coloured balls. Every time you move one ball you get three more. If you have five or more balls in line then they will dissappear and your score will increase. You must try to get the highest score!
            </p>

                <li><a href="https://github.com/xShteff/JSLines" target="_blank">Repo</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://xshteff.github.io/JSLines" target="_blank">Demo</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                JSInterface
            </h2>
            <p>
                Attempting to make some kind of game interface that would work on mobile devices as well. Idea came after playing this browser game for over 8 years and seeing it's interface not being updated all this time. I wanted to attempt to make one myself and see how hard would it be.

            </ul>
            <h2>A self-building webpage</h2>
            <p>
                A totally not original idea. I would link the place where I've seen it but sadly I can't find it anymore. The entire idea behind this is having a "live coding" session where you see some CSS code in front of you and you see the entire page change right
                in front of your eyes! I have made two versions of this, first of them which is just so damn horrible as it was made while learning how to javascript, and the second one which was made around one year later, which is somewhat decent. I
                will be saving your sanity by only linking the most recent one.

            </ul>
            <h2>A JavaScript only Poker game!</h2>
            <p>
                Another project made while learning JavaScript. Sadly there's no re-master version of this one. You'll have to deal with one ridiculously long method that for some reason is recursive too, that decides whether or not you won or not. The entire game is
                made by using 0 images.
            </p>

            <h2>TW Best Friends</h2>
            <p>
                TW stands for "The-West", which is the browser game mentioned in my experience section. This is an userscript, pretty much something that runs once the game loads and enhances your gaming experience. This script has been made with the help of Diggo11
                who at the time was a Community Manager and a Game Developer for the game itself.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/xShteff/TW-Best-Friends" target="_blank">Repo</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The Magic Bundle</h2>
            <p>
                Again, an userscript for The-West. This one has two versions as well, in this case they are not separate. First of them has been made while learning how to work with JavaScript and the final version has been done a bit later. It contains a bunch of older
                projects merged into only one. It provides features such as improved notifications, a task killer, it auto-buys products for you, it adds a new Veteran Point counter (at the time there was no way of seeing them), and a fancy shmancy neon
                experience bar (which yes, is useless but cool).
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/xShteff/TWKappa" target="_blank">Repo</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>TW Kappa</h2>
            <p>
                Yet another userscript. This one integrates <a href="https://twitch.tv" target="_blank">twitch.tv's</a> emoticon list into The-West! ...and a few extra ones. That's it. Oh, the script uses an API hosted by <a href="http://twitchemotes.com"
                    target="_blank">twitchemotes.com</a>. I apparently have to mention that otherwise I'd be in trouble.
            </p>

                <li><a href="https://github.com/xShteff/Magic-Bundle-v2" target="_blank">Repo</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>this</h2>
            <p>Literally this.</p>
