                 Software Engineering Graduate with core competences in designing and developing applications and user interfaces using ASP.NET Framework including C#, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and Git as main technologies.

            <p>
                I moved here back in 2014 in order to study ICT Engineering at VIA University College, which of course I graduated back in February 2018. Back in High School I actually studied Social Sciences due to the fact that I wasn't best friends with the study system back home, and I had pretty much zero chances to pursue my one passion since I was a child. Computer Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                By moving in Denmark I had a chance to pretty much have a 'fresh start' and I finally got a chance to achieve my dream. I went through college without failing a single class and I did so by gaining above average grades.

                First task required quite a bit of prototyping as I got to work with technologies such as Apache Cordova (PhoneGap), Xamarin or native Android Development. The final application was built on the .NET Framework, as an ASP.NET application. The purpose of this application was giving people installing the new EnergyConnectors a detailed guide on how to perform their job. We would also give them a chance to test the connection to our servers with the freshly installed units, and help them troubleshoot in case an issue would happen. This project saved the company a lot of time (and money), as each unit installment would take up to five-six hours, in which both the person installing the unit and one of our IT supporters would have to be on a phone call to communicate every single piece of data given by the application.\n\n \
                Second task implied completely re-building the old, static bootstrap-based interface to a widget based one, or a tile system as we ended up calling it. The new system also allowed the user to have multiple of the old views into a single page, that he would be able to move and scale however he pleases, therefore creating an infinite amount of possible views. The system was built with GridStack, an open source JavaScript library based on JQueryUI, however, we considered other libraries such as GreenSock or JQueryUI standalone.",
